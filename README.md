This is an interactive R Shiny app, which visualizes terrorist attacks conducted in Iraq and Syria from the 1970's-2016.  Data was visualized
via ggplot2 and made interactive with Plot.ly wrappers.  The geocoordinates were geospatially rendered, which enabled me to label each
set of coordinates with the type of attack, type of weapon and terrorist group that conducted the attack.  

I began this project in the fall of 2017 as the captsone project for my Master's degree in Applied Analytics at Saint Louis University.  
Though I'm quite happy with the work I was able to accomplish, at some point I will refine and scale up the project to include more data
and more locations.
